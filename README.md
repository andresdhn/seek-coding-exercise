The code renders a "Checkout" function that creates a *Client Object* upon instance. Expects a newRules Object for each client. The rules can be rewritten each time to be changed. 

It has two methods to __Add__ and __Remove__ Products for the Client, and the __total__ method should return the Checkout todal for the client based on available products and Client specific rules. 

This is my interpretation of the request. Hope it is good. I dedicated only enough time to make it testable, clean, and escalable. 

`$ yarn test`

Build 

`$ yarn build`

Thanks.
